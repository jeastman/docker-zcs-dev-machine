# NOTES:
1. No quotes around the following
2. Relative paths, such as the following, will work in most situations.
3. If you are using Docker for Windows and are issuing docker commands from the
   Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) you should do the following:
   a. Work from a git repo that is checked out "on the windows side", and so you would
      access it from the WSL shell from a path that looks like this:
	  /mnt/c/Users/<user>/...
   b. Specify absolute path value in these two environment variables (no trailing slashes, please).
   c. The abosolute path should use the modern path syntax.  See the examples in the commented out
      values that follow.
